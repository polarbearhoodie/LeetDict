# Once Upon A Time,
I thought that coding was easy. Just make a function, make a variable, you have input, output, loop around, do some things, viola! Done.

Defining the inputs and outputs within a program felt harder than actually writing the code. Knowing I would have to revisit my code in a few months, and needing to integrate it with existing services and remembering their restrictions was arguably more difficult than implementing the datasheet. None of the real world difficulty in programming seems to come from the code itself. Rather, it came from the buisness logic that surrounds the code and all the edge cases that existed in the real world.

## The World Seemed Rather Flat.
I thought that with my skills, getting a job (even in something tangentially related to my major) was at least easier than just trying to enter the workforce from high school. Unfortunately, the "Economy" had other plans.

I put away this pile of garbage functions and thought for a while what I actually wanted to do with my life. At the end, my choices were to continue down this doomed path or do something different. I chose a middling option.

## Then I Grew Up,
Thinking that I would only have the input and output of a single function. Everything isolated, well written, where I would never need to worry about reading hundreds of pages of documentation and datasheets to write 2 or 3 lines of code. Yeah, thats a thing. At this point, I am a user more than I am a programmer. Even when I do program, it is just one more layer of abstraction deep. But you know what? I hit bare metal. Now I need to go the other way.

## And It was Really Oblong
I am here again, looking at the clever ways to solve and optimize a programming problem. I was really good at it, once. Now I wonder if it ever had any relation to programming at all. Building up a foundation all the way up from analog voltage wasn't really planned, it just happened in the meantime. Well. Now I have to grind leetcode again because I've been in C99 land too long.
